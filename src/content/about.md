title: About verycool.tech
---
Verycool.tech is a digital media website created by Daniel Dunderfelt. We publish mostly news and opinion about technology and other phenomena found in the modern world.

### The technology

The site is built with open-source technologies (GatsbyJS)[https://www.gatsbyjs.org/] and [React](https://reactjs.org/). We use [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to manage content and we are hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). These technologies and services are what enables this website to work reliably and fast like lightning!

For analytics we use the open-source app [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) installed on our own server. Fathom allows us to gather valuable insight into how the website is performing while not encroaching on our readers' privacy. Read more in our [privacy policy](/privacy-policy).

### The people

So far verycool.tech is one person, Daniel Dunderfelt. Hi! I am a freelance web developer and I created this site with the technologies described above. I am looking to expand at some point, so if writing for a tech site sounds fun to you, please contact me at *editor@verycool.tech*. The site isn't generating any revenue as of writing, but I plan to address that at some point through ads and sponsored content or other more innovative means. (TODO: update this part when that happens. TODO: remove the todo's)
